This file serves for evaluating the performance, pros and cons of Sapphire bot we are considering either as a replacement or a backup bot to the current one we are seeing responsivenes issues with commonly.
The evaluation period started on the 15th of June 2024 and currently has no set end date.
__Pros__
* error log available in dashboard
* Better embeds/panels
* Ephemeral messaging
* Autorole sync
* Many more message hook options
* Message/user reporting 
* Options to ignore/respond to other bots in some contexts 
* Backup download
* Copy existing messages (embeds included)
* command aliases available
* up to 5 possible prefixes
* ability to make custom commands also use /
* pricing loophole regarding the new discord application purchase policies 
__Cons__
* custom / commands are private only as far as I can tell
* custom pricing same or 2 eur more expensive depending on server size
* somewhat more convoluted dashboard
* Messages are annoying to design, everything goes through a template 
* Moving bot again is tough, could have the same thing again, who knows 
* Moving modlogs the second time will be convoluted
* found no autopurge at the moment
* automod yet to be tested
